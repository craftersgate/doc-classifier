The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid_sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third_party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid_ sized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third_party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value_added resellers. During 2015, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 26% and 74%, respectively, of total net sales.
The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high_quality sales and after_sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.
To ensure a high_quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company’s retail stores are typically located at high_traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high_traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Company’s products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third_party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Company’s products.

  Table of Contents

The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third_party resellers and its online and retail stores.
The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable operating segments. The Company’s products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Company’s products are compatible with thousands of third_party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
Competition
The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. The Company’s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry_wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third_party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well_funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Company’s products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.
The Company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer_to_peer music and video services.
The Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Internet Services). Some of the Company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company’s offerings.
Supply of Components
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry_wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.
Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10_K | 5

  Table of Contents
 The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often utilizes custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.
While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole_ sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.
Research and Development
Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete su"

 Item 1. Business:
PART I
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry- leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.
Strategy
IBM has transformed throughout its 100+ year history, and in its current transformation, IBM is leading a reordering of the technology industry.
In 2014, the company's strategic imperatives were declared around the three main forces behind ""digital"": big data and analytics, cloud and engagement. Since 2010, IBM has invested approximately $30 billion in these areas, built out the IBM Cloud on a global scale, established the Watson Group, announced 50 acquisitions and entered into major partnerships, including the landmark alliance with Apple to bring mobile to the enterprise.
As IBM's clients transform, ""digital"" itself is not the destination, but a foundation to create a truly Cognitive Enterprise. This is resulting in new types of interactions between people, organizations and machines.
Through these developments, IBM is emerging as more than a hardware, software and services company; IBM is transforming into a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. Key tenets of the company's highly differentiated strategy include:
Cognitive Solutions: Cognitive, advanced analytics and key data are being integrated into all leading solutions.
Cloud Platform: New solutions will be built on the IBM Cloud and the company's offerings will be cloud-enabled. The company is
continuing to build the premier cloud stack, developer environment and most secure hybrid cloud platform in the industry.
Industry Focus: Because industry context is so important to the value of IBM's solutions, these solutions will be built for the needs of individual industries and professions.
Cognitive Solutions
Since 2011 when IBM's Watson was introduced, IBM has been developing a new generation of cognitive systems that can see and analyze the massive amounts of data that have previously been invisible to computers and enterprises. Cognitive systems have the capability to inject a kind of thinking ability into every digitalized object, process and service. IBM is on the forefront of deploying these systems and assisting clients to become truly Cognitive Enterprises.
1
 
 Cognitive systems are not programmed; like humans, they learn from experts, from every interaction, and from big data. They are enabled to learn by using advanced algorithms to sense, predict and infer. Ultimately they can augment human intelligence, allowing individuals to make more informed decisions.
For the past five years, IBM has continued to invest in Watson, including dedicating $100 million to venture investments to support start-ups building cognitive apps through the Watson Developer Zone on Bluemix. IBM is also making Watson more widely available through the Watson Ecosystem, which has grown to more than 500 partners.
Paired with Watson is the company's core big data and analytics business. IBM has invested over $15 billion in these areas since 2010, including over $7 billion on more than 20 acquisitions. Nearly half of IBM Research's spending is focused on analytics and cognitive.
IBM's leading-edge cognitive technology is only the starting point. The company is developing entirely new solutions businesses around that cognitive capability. In 2015, the Watson Health unit was formed, which is IBM's first business unit designed around a single industry. Watson Health will create cognitive solutions that can better help doctors diagnose and anticipate disease; it will recommend treatments that are tailored to individuals; and it will assist researchers to predict and prevent the next generation of diseases.
Another set of cognitive solutions IBM is building is the Internet of Things (IoT). It is estimated that there are more than 9 billion connected devices operating in the world today, generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily. Watson IoT will bring the power of cognitive to the challenge of extracting and analyzing data embedded in intelligent devices in real time. In addition, the recent closure of The Weather Company acquisition essentially expands the company's IoT platform; with one that collects, integrates and analyzes data from three billion weather forecast reference points, including satellites, weather stations, airplanes, consumer apps and more for IBM and our clients.
Through Cognitive, IBM is ushering in a new era for the industry and for clients.
Cloud Platform
Cloud is at the heart of the ""digital"" revolution. No enterprise is untouched by this revolution and the shifts are occurring rapidly.
Enterprises are benefiting from cloud by using it to transform their information technology (IT) and business processes into digital services. Cloud brings two compelling sources of value:
• Innovation: In addition to cloud enabling the sharing of infrastructure, the real promise of cloud is innovation. By forcing greater levels of standards throughout the technology value chain, new products and services, and even entire business models, can be created in weeks rather than months or years.
• Hybrid: Data, cloud and engagement are powerful forces changing the landscape of technology and businesses. Enterprises need to bring this new world of technology together with their existing systems in order to capture their full value. Hybrid cloud brings together the back-end systems infrastructure with the new strategic imperative ""digital"" technologies. Unless the new and traditional IT worlds are brought together, they will be isolated within the enterprise. IBM servers and storage can handle mobile transactions, compose and expose APIs and integrate across hybrid clouds to unlock new value from data.
Making applications work across on-premise, public and private cloud environments is what hybrid cloud is all about. This requires a deep understanding of both traditional and new IT models, something that IBM is unique in bringing to its clients:
2
 
 • In traditional IT, for example, the z Systems mainframe is used by all of the top 25 global banks and almost three-quarters of the top 25 U.S. retailers. In addition, 70 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies rely on IBM to manage their critical IT infrastructures.
• In the new world of IT, the IBM Cloud has become the standard for enterprise-grade cloud—bringing performance and the integration across all IT. The company continues to build cloud into Global Technology Services' (GTS) large base of outsourcing relationships.
• Each of these areas of IT requires uncompromising security. IBM Security brings to clients advanced technologies in fraud and threat protection, identity and access management, application and data security, mobile and cloud security. IBM's systems are among the most secure in the world with advanced encryption, threat monitoring and tracking and behavioral analytics. Further, high-end security consulting brings the expertise of 6,000 dedicated security specialists. Built on big data analytics, IBM manages over 20 billion security events per day on 2.5 million desktops for 12,000 clients through its Security Operations Centers.
IBM's Cloud platform includes:
• IBM Cloud's Infrastructure-as-a-Service, which offers bare metal, private cloud and virtual server instances, enabling it to cover many different workloads with unprecedented performance. IBM's platform also has tremendous geographic reach— with 46 cloud centers around the globe.
• Bluemix is IBM's Platform-as-a-Service, built on the open standards foundation of Cloud Foundry and powered by IBM Cloud's infrastructure. Bluemix offers cloud-based services, APIs and leading third-party services to developers in an integrated platform. With $1 billion of investment, Bluemix is now the largest Cloud Foundry development, has a significant number of services and is onboarding thousands of developers per week.
• IBM Cloud Marketplace brings together the company's extensive portfolio of cloud capabilities, providing a self-service, digital experience for developers, IT and business leaders. IBM has a significant number of Software-as-a-Service offerings and visitors to the Marketplace have access to an extensive and growing portfolio of cloud capabilities from IBM and qualified third-party vendors.
• In 2015, IBM acquired: Blue Box Group, Inc. (private cloud), Compose (database-as-a-service), StrongLoop, Inc. (developer technology), Cleversafe, Inc. (object-based storage), Gravitant, Inc. (cloud brokerage) and Clearleap, Inc. (cloud- based video).
• The Weather Company acquisition in January 2016, whose dynamic cloud data platform powers the fourth most-used daily mobile app in the United States and handles 26 billion inquiries to its cloud-based services each day. This high-volume cloud platform processes, analyzes and distributes enormous data sets at scale in real time. It adds an important dimension to the company's cloud platform.
• IBM has entered into strategic partnerships all focused on bringing innovative data and analytics solutions to the market. The IBM Cloud is the most powerful platform for enterprise-grade environments, bringing clients unparalleled levels of security, performance and scalability.
Industry Focus
IBM's solutions and platforms are most relevant in the context of each client's industry. General-purpose tools have their place, but the company can unlock much greater value in building solutions for the specific needs of an industry. In this context, Industries are the focus.
Watson Health is an example of how the company is defining solutions around industry needs. In addition to Watson Health, in 2015, 20 new industry-specific analytics solutions were launched with
3
 
 pre-built predictive analytics capabilities. These include solutions that allow clients to mine customer data for hidden insights for action, spot fraud or risk and predict vulnerabilities to preempt before they occur. These solutions, which are tailored specifically for retail, banking, telecommunications, insurance and others, will make it easier and faster for organizations to uncover and act on critical business insights. In addition, IBM has announced over 100 apps through its alliance with Apple that bring value in the context of individual industries.
Complementing the power of the company's technology solutions is the industry expertise of IBM's Global Business Services consulting business. It is the combination of IBM's technology and services, which enable clients to achieve their business outcomes.
Summary
Each successive transformation of IBM has brought something new and innovative to the world. More than 50 years ago, IBM brought forward a revolutionary transactional computer called the mainframe. In the decades that followed, IBM commercialized the personal computer, created an industry around IT services and a software market around middleware. Each of these innovations is with the world today; they were built to last.
The company's next chapter is ushering in an entirely new era of human-organization-computer interaction—embodied in Cognitive Solutions and the Cloud Platform.
Business Model
The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to become more innovative, efficient and competitive through the application of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have superior long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.
The company's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide integrated solutions and platforms to the company's clients.
The business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including the company's transformation into cloud and as-a-service delivery models. The company continues to strengthen its position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas while divesting certain businesses. In addition, the company is transforming into a more agile enterprise helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity.
This business model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term.
Business Segments and Capabilities
The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, which the company collectively calls Global Services, Software, Systems Hardware and Global Financing.

 PART I
ITEM 1. Business
McDonald’s Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the “Company.”
a. General development of business
During 2010, there have been no material changes to the Company’s corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. In 2010, the Company has continued the process it began in 2005 to realign certain subsidiaries to develop a corporate structure within its geographic segments that better reflects the operation of the McDonald’s worldwide business.
b. Financial information about segments
Segment data for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are included in Part II, Item 8, page 40 of this
Form 10_K.
c. Narrative description of business
• General
The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants in the global restaurant industry. These restaurants serve a varied, yet limited, value_priced menu (see Products) in more than 100 countries around the world.
All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchise arrangements, and foreign affiliated markets and developmental licensees under license agreements.
The Company’s operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every restaurant. When granting franchises or licenses, the Company is selective and generally is not in the practice of franchising to passive investors.
Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and de_cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long_term leases for both Company_operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. A discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, Item 2, page 6 of this Form 10_K.
Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company’s revenue stream through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees received upon the opening of a new restaurant or the granting of a new franchise term. The conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years, and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. Over 70% of franchised restaurants operate under conventional franchise arrangements.
The Company has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliated markets, referred to as affiliates. The largest of these affiliates is Japan, where there are more than 3,300 restaurants. The Company receives a royalty based on a percent of sales in these markets.
Under a developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest. While the Company has no capital invested, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, as well as initial fees. The largest of these developmental license arrangements operates more than 1,750 restaurants across 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and strictly enforces high quality standards and product specifications. The Company has quality assurance labs around the world to ensure that its high standards are consistently met. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on_site inspections of suppliers’ facilities. A quality assurance board, composed of the Company’s technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term.
Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to most McDonald’s restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of products and in the delivery of customer service.
McDonald’s global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonald’s brand image and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste, menu choice and the customer experience. The Company continuously endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long_term sustainability, which benefits McDonald’s and the communities it serves.
The Company has disposed of non_McDonald’s restaurant businesses to concentrate resources on its core business. In February 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, and in April 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K._ based Pret A Manger.

• Backlog
Company_operated restaurants have no backlog orders.
• Government contracts
No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.
• Competition
McDonald’s restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry.
In measuring the Company’s competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Company’s primary competition, which management refers to as the Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: quick_service eating establishments, casual dining full_service restaurants, 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or kiosks, specialist coffee shops and self_service cafeterias. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full_service restaurants other than casual dining.
Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 6.3 million outlets and generated $868 billion in annual sales in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available. McDonald’s Systemwide 2009 restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.5% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales.
Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonald’s against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all other full_service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately 13.1 million outlets and generated about $1.79 trillion in annual sales in 2009. McDonald’s Systemwide restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.2% of those outlets and about 4% of the sales.
• Research and development
The Company operates research and development facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. While research and development activities are important to the Company’s business, these expenditures are not material. Independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System).
• Environmental matters
Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs, including for the Company, its franchisees and suppliers. Also, there is a possibility that governmental initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns or climate, could have a direct impact on the operations of our restaurants or the operations of our suppliers in ways which we cannot predict at this time.
The Company monitors developments related to environmental matters and plans to respond to governmental initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner. At this time, the Company has already undertaken its own initiatives relating to preservation of the environment, including the development of means of monitoring and reducing energy use, in many of its markets.
• Number of employees
The Company’s number of employees worldwide, including Company_operated restaurant employees, was approximately 400,000 as of year_end 2010.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward_Looking Statements
This report includes forward_looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2011. These statements use such words as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe” and “plan.” They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward_looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of our major markets, and this may continue. The current environment, including persistently high unemployment rates in many of our markets, has also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing pressures across the industry. Combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs, these circumstances could affect our ability to continue to grow comparable sales and margins despite the strength of our brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, as well as by
the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter.”
The risks we face can have an impact both in the near_ and long_term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and results—people, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:
• Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us;
• Our ability to drive restaurant improvements and to motivate our restaurant personnel to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments;
• Whether our restaurant reimaging and rebuilding efforts, which remain a priority notwithstanding the current challenging economic and operating environment, are targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals to enhance the relevance of our brand and achieve an efficient allocation of our capital resources;
• The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees and developmental licensees will have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital_intensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by local law or otherwise, costly to exercise or subject to litigation;
• The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence;
• Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick_service category of the IEO segment or about our products, promotions and premiums, such as Happy Meals (collectively, our products), or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of our products, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald’s of food_borne illnesses or product safety issues;
• The success of our plans to improve existing menu items and to roll out new menu items, as well as the impact of our competitors’ actions, including in response to our menu changes and product introductions, and our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations;

 • Our ability to differentiate the McDonald’s experience in a way that balances consumer value with margin expansion, particularly in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by the current challenging economic and operating environment;
• The impact of pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic conditions;
• The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonald’s System and whose performance has a material impact on our results;
• Our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth in certain developing markets;
• Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost_ effective way; and
• The costs and operational risks associated with our increasing reliance on information technology (including our point_of_sale and other in_store technology systems or platforms), such as the need for increasing investments to upgrade and maintain our systems, the potential for system failures or programming errors and the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments becomes more widespread.
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company_ operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide_ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates and continuing uncertainty in financial and credit markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer confidence and spending. Moreover, the strength of the current recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following:
• Whether our strategies will permit us to compete effectively and make continued market share gains despite the uncertain economic outlook, while at the same time achieving sales and operating income within our targeted long_term average annual range of growth;
• The effectiveness of our supply chain management, including hedging strategies, to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms;
• The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates, as well as governmental actions to manage national economic matters, including austerity initiatives, credit availability, unemployment and taxation rates, all of which can also affect relative levels of disposable income and discretionary expenditures, such as food away from home;
• The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor_ intensive business model, the long_term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and any potential impact of union organizing efforts;
• Whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants from year to year, and whether new sites are as profitable as expected;
• The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, such as China and Russia, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; and
• The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings.
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:
• The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, especially in the United States where inconsistent standards imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, and the impact of new, potential or changing regulation that affects or restricts elements of our business, particularly those relating to marketing to children, nutritional content and product labeling and safety;
• The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business;
• The risks and costs of McDonald’s nutritional labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and

 the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information obtained from third party suppliers;
• The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities and non_governmental organizations on environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption, including as a result of initiatives that effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions;
• The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor and employment claims and landlord/tenant disputes; the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; and the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;
• Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices;
• The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations relating to wage and hour practices, immigration, mandatory healthcare benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination;
• The impact of the current economic conditions on unemployment levels and consumer confidence and the effect of initiatives to stimulate economic recovery and to further regulate financial markets on the cost and availability of funding for the Company and its franchisees, inflation and foreign exchange rates;
• Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import_export controls, increased tariffs or government_mandated closure of our or our vendors’ operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit;
• The legal and compliance risks associated with information technology, such as the costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the potential costs associated with alleged security breaches (including the loss of consumer confidence that may result and the risk of criminal penalties or civil liability to consumers or employees whose data is alleged to have been collected or used inappropriately) and potential challenges to the associated intellectual property rights; and
• The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or authoritative interpretations relating"
